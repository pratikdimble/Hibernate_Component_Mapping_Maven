Hibernate - Component Mappings
A Component mapping is a mapping for a class having a reference to another class as a member variable.
We have seen such mapping while having two tables and using <set> element in the mapping file.
  Now we will use <component> element in the mapping file and a single table would be used to keep the attributes contained inside the class variable.
